# HACKTIV8_FP_Recommendation-Mutual-Fund-Investment-based-on-Risk-Profile-Customer

In this project, We are giving a mutual fund recommendation based on Customer risk profile and help candidate investors to acknowledge their risk profile 
and choose the available products based on their risk profiling score. After we made a recommendation, we add a feature where we could show future predictions of the price within a particular product. 
We used Supervised Machine Learning- Classification Model and Time Series Forecasting.
